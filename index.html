		<h1>Solo - The Hohn Family Card Game</h1>
		<h3 class="para">History of the game</h3>
			<p>Solo originated in Germany as a simplified version of l'Hombre; a card game that had its beginnings in 17<sup>th</sup> century Spain. 
			Similar games to this are Solo Whist, an English version of Solo and Six-bid Solo. The version of Solo explained below came from my Hohn
			ancestors in Germany and the game emigrated with them to South Dakota where they settled, and then on to the west coast of the U.S.</p>
		
		<h3 class="para">Number of Players</h3>
			<p>Solo is a game played with four to six players. Game play starts to the dealers immediate left unless there are five or six players. 
			When there are five players, the dealer will sit out of the hand. If there is a sixth player, the dealer and the player immediately 
			to the dealers left will sit out of the hand.</p>
		
		<h3 class="para">Game Explanation</h3>
			<p>The game uses 32 cards from a standard card deck consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 in each suit. Each player is dealt 8 cards and 
			is ultimately playing for themselves, though temporary patnerships are created by bidding. The game is over when a player(s) wins the 
			amount of tricks that were bid at the begining of the hand, or is not able to reach that amount. Card play follows the standard heirarchy 
			with a few exceptions, which will be explained below in more detail.</p>
			
			<p>Dealing begins to the dealers left. A 3/2/3 dealing scheme or any personal preference can be incorporated to distribute the cards.</p> 
		
		<h4 class="para">Card Heirarchy</h4>
			<p>As mentioned above, only cards Ace through 7 are used in this game. The game follows standard heirarchy with the 
			following exceptions:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><em>Trump Cards</em></dt>
						<dd>Trump cards are used similar to how they are played in Spades. Any card that is designated
							as trump is ranked higher than all other non-trump cards. i.e. If spades are trump, a 9 of spades will beat
							an ace of any other suit.</dd>
						<p>Below is a list of trump cards by suit.</p>
						<dd><strong>Clubs</strong> (highest value): &clubs; Q, &clubs; 7, &spades; Q, &clubs; A, &clubs; K, &clubs; J, &clubs; 10, 
							&clubs; 9, &clubs; 8.</dd>
						<dd><strong>Spades</strong>: &clubs; Q, &spades; 7, &spades; Q, &spades; A, &spades; K, &spades; J, &spades; 10, &spades; 9, 
								&spades; 8.</dd>
						<dd><strong><span style="color:red;">Hearts</span></strong>: &clubs; Q, <span style="color:red;">&hearts; </span>7, 
							&spades; Q, <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> A, <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> K, 
							<span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> Q, <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> J, <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span>10,
							<span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> 9, <span style="color:red;">&hearts;</span> 8.</dd>
						<dd><strong><span style="color:red;">Diamonds</span></strong>: &clubs; Q, <span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> 7, &spades; Q, 
							<span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> A, <span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> K, <span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> Q, 
							<span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> J, <span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> 10, <span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> 9, 
							<span style="color:red;">&diams;</span> 8.</dd></br>
				</dl>
			<p>In all four suit structures, the queen of clubs is the highest, the 7 of trump second, and the queen of spades is third. These cards 
			are usually referred to as the Old, the Spits, and the Blue, respectively.</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hint</strong>: There are different amounts of trump cards depending on the suit. Clubs and spades have nine
			trump; hearts and diamonds have 10 trump.</p>
		
		
		<h3 class="para">Bidding</h3>
			
			<p>Bidding begins with the player to the dealer's left. A bid is stating what type of hand the bidder wishes to play. Higher value bids
			override lower ones.</p>
			
			<p>There are two main types of bids:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><em>Solo</em></dt>
						<dd>A solo bid means the player will play against all three other players and attempt to reach the number of tricks
						that were bid at the begining of the hand.</dd>
						<dd>A player may bid 5, 6, or 7 tricks for a solo hand. If 5 tricks are bid, clubs must be the trump suit. For
						6 and 7 trick bids, any suit may be trump.</dd>
					<dt><em>Partner</em></dt>
						<dd>A partner bid is when a player cannot win enough tricks to play solo, and will request a partner, usually done by 
						stating the suit of an ace*. i.e. player bids 6 spades with the Heart Ace. The bidder is stating that he or she will win a minimum
						of six tricks with the help of the person holding the Ace of Hearts.</dd>
						<dd>* If the bidder has all four aces, he or she can ask for the king. This needs to be stated during the bid.</dd>
						<dd>A player may bid 6 or 7 tricks for a partner hand. Any suit may be played.</dd>
				</dl>
				
			<p>Once a player decides on what to bid, they use the following phrases. The list increases in higher value bids.</p>
			
				<dl>
					<dt><em>Pass</em></dt>
						<dd>Pass indicates you do not want to make a bid on the current hand.</dd>
					<dt><em>Play</em></dt>
						<dd>Play signifies that you are willing to make a bid without committing to a suit or bid number.<dd>
					<dt><em>6 or 7</em></dt>
						<dd>A player can bid 6 or 7 tricks depending on the strength of their hand.</dd>
					<dt><em>Clubs</em></dt>
						<dd>The Clubs suit outranks the other suits in Solo. If there are multiple bids of equal tricks, a player can state they
						are calling Clubs as the trump suit. In order to outbid clubs, a player must call for a higher value bid or go solo.</dd>
						<p>Example: If player #2 bids 6, player #3 must bid 6 clubs or 7 of any suit or solo.</p>
					<dt><em>Solo</em></dt>
						<dd>Solo indicates you will be playing against the other three players.</dd>
				</dl>
			
			<p>Below are the different types of bids valued from lowest to highest:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Bid of 6 using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 Clubs</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 Clubs</li>
					<li>Bid of 5 Club solo</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 solo using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 solo using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 Club solo</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 Club solo</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h3 class="para">Partner</h3>
				<p>The player that makes the highest bid will call for a partner when not going solo. The bidder states which ace (not one in their
				hand) they want for partner (the ace can not be the trump suit). The player with the ace must play the ace the first time that suit 
				is played during the hand. </p>
				
			<h3 class="para">Queens</h3>
				<img src="images/queen_clubs.jpg" alt="Queen of Clubs" width="200" height="200">
				<img src="images/queen_spades.jpg" alt="Queen of Spades" width="200" height="200">
			<p>Queens is called out when a player has both the Queens of clubs and spades. If the bidder can go solo, do not call out queens. 
			If the bidder can not go solo, he or she will state that they have the queens. The bidder will call an ace (not one in their hand) 
			as partner. The player with the ace will bid the number of tricks and trump suit*.</p>
			<p>* An unwritten rule of the game during Queens play is the bidder will call for an ace that is opposite in color of what he or she
			wants for trump. i.e. The bidder calls for the Ace of hearts as a partner. The player with the Ace of hearts should typically bid 
			diamonds as the trump suit. This does depend on the strength of that suit, though.</p>
		
			<h4 class="para">Playing with money</h4>
			<p>If the players choose to play with money, each losing partner will pay one of the winning partners. If solo is bid, the winner will 
			receive the appropriate amount from each player. If the player who bid solo loses, he or she must pay each player. Listed below are 
			the values of each hand:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Bid of 6 using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds - $0.25</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds - $0.75</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 Clubs - $0.50</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 Clubs - $1.00</li>
					<li>Bid of 5 Club solo - $0.50</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 solo using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds - $0.75</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 solo using Spades, Hearts, or Diamonds - $1.00</li>
					<li>Bid of 6 Club solo - $1.25</li>
					<li>Bid of 7 Club solo - $1.50</li>
				</ul>
		
			<h3 class="para">Playing through</h3>
			<p>Once the bidder or bidding team reaches the amount of tricks that were bid at the beginning of the hand, the bidder or the bidders 
			partner has the option to continue the hand. If it is decided to "play through," and the bidders win the hand, the amount paid out is 
			doubled. If the bidders do not reach 7 tricks, they must pay the other players the amounts listed under "playing with money."</p>
